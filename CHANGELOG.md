## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `Button` and `ButtonGroup`. A button says `Button::Pressed` for `Enter`, `Space` and a click that
  goes down and comes up inside it; a group is a row or a column the arrows along it move between,
  and an exclusive one is a radio set saying `ButtonGroup::Changed`.
- `Checkbox` and `CheckboxGroup`. `Space` and a click turn a box over and it says
  `Checkbox::Changed`. A group holds `min` and `max` bounds on how many of its boxes may be ticked,
  puts back a toggle that would break one, and says `CheckboxGroup::Refused` instead of `Changed`.
  The marks are measured under the tree's own width policy, and an ASCII pair is taken wherever the
  pretty one does not come out at a cell each.
- `TextArea`, for typing more than one line. `Enter` breaks the line and up and down move by drawn
  row rather than by line, keeping the column they set out from. It wraps by words, anywhere or not
  at all, grows horizontally, vertically, both or neither, scrolls to keep the cursor in view, and
  says `TextArea::Changed` and `TextArea::Accepted`. What hands the text over is `#accept_keys`,
  which is `Ctrl+Enter` and `Alt+Enter` by default: only a terminal speaking the kitty keyboard
  protocol can tell `Ctrl+Enter` from `Enter`.
- `Validator`, a proc from the text to a message or `nil`, and `Validators` with `required`,
  `length`, `matches`, `numeric`, `one_of` and `all`.
- `ValidatedField`, a `Field` holding its line to a list of rules. A line that passes leaves as
  `Field::Accepted`; one that does not leaves as `ValidatedField::Invalid`, stays in the field so
  that there is something to correct, and has the first refusal drawn under it.
- `MaskedField`, a validated field drawing a mark for every character, with `#value` for the text
  as typed and `#reveal?` for showing it. The mark is measured the way a checkbox's marks are, and
  the scrolling is counted in marks rather than in cells.
